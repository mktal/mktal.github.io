It has been a major challenge to improve the ride-hailing marketplace efficiency due to spatio-temporal imbalance between the supply and demand. Classic approaches to improve marketplace efficiency usually optimize pricing or dispatch separately. We show that these two processes are in fact intrinsically interrelated, and motivated by this observation, we make an attempt to simultaneously optimize pricing and dispatch strategies.
