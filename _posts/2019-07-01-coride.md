We model ride-hailing as a large-scale parallel ranking problem and study the joint decision-making task of order dispatching and fleet management.
We leverage the geographical hierarchy of the region grids to perform hierarchical reinforcement learning.
And to deal with the heterogeneous and variant action space for joint order dispatching and fleet management, we design the action as the ranking weight vector to rank and select the specific order or the fleet management destination in a unified formulation.
