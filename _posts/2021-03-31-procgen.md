The NeurIPS 2020 Procgen Competition by <a href="https://sourl.cn/qfAvvb">OpenAI</a> was designed as a centralized benchmark with clearly defined tasks for measuring Sample Efficiency and Generalization in Reinforcement Learning.
This paper presents the competition setup and the details and analysis of the top solutions identified through this setup in context of 2020 iteration of the competition at NeurIPS.
