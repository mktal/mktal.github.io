Recently several methods were proposed for sparse optimization which make careful use of second-order information to improve  local  convergence  rates. We propose a general framework, which includes slightly modified versions of existing algorithms and also a new algorithm, which uses limited memory BFGS Hessian  approximations,  and  provide a novel global convergence rate analysis, which covers methods that solve subproblems via coordinate descent.
