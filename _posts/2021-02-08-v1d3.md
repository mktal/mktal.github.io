We propose a unified value-based dynamic learning framework (V1D3) for tackling both order dispatching and vehicle repositioning. At the center of the framework is a globally shared value function that is updated continuously using online experiences generated from real-time platform transactions. V1D3 outperforms the first prize winners of both dispatching and repositioning tracks in the KDD Cup 2020 RL competition, achieving state-of-the-art results on improving both total driver income and user experience related metrics.
