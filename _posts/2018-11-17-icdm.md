Ride dispatching is a central operation task on a ride-sharing platform to continuously match drivers to trip-requesting passengers. We propose learning solutions based on deep Q-networks with action search to optimize the dispatching policy for drivers on ride-sharing platforms. We train and evaluate dispatching agents for this challenging decision task using real-world spatio-temporal trip data from the DiDi ride-sharing platform.
