We present a fast decomposition method for network optimization problems, with application to real-time traffic control. Our approach is based on a nonlinear programming formulation of the network control problem and consists of an alternating directions method using forward numerical simulation inplace of one of the optimization subproblems. The method is scalable to realistic city-size road networks for real-time applications, and is shown to perform well on synthetic and real traffic networks.
