We propose a new hybrid optimization algorithm that solves the elastic-net support vector machine (SVM) through an alternating direction method of multipliers in the first phase, followed by an interior-point method for the classical SVM in the second phase. Both SVM formulations are adapted to knowledge incorporation. Our  proposed  algorithm  addresses  the  challenges  of  automatic  feature selection, high optimization accuracy, and algorithmic flexibility for taking advantage of prior knowledge.
