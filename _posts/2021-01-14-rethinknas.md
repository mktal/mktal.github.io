We provide empirical and theoretical analysis on the magnitude of architecture parameters and find that several failure modes of Darts can be greatly alleviated with the proposed perturbation-based method, indicating that much of the poor generalization observed in Darts can be attributed to the failure of magnitude-based architecture selection rather than entirely the optimization of its supernet.
