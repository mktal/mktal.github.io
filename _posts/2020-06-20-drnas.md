This paper proposes a novel differentiable architecture search method by formulating it into a distribution learning problem. We treat the continuously relaxed architecture mixing weight as random variables, modeled by Dirichlet distribution. We obtain a test error of 2.46% for CIFAR-10, 23.7% for ImageNet under the mobile setting.
