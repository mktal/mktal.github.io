The challenge that the participants are to solve involves a combination of order dispatching (order matching) and vehicle repositioning (fleet management) on an MoD platform.  The teams are to develop algorithms for either or both of these tasks.  The algorithms are evaluated in a simulation environment that simulates the dynamics of an MoD platform.
